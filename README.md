# Towards an Atlas of Design Problems, Tasks, and Cognitive Constructs in DTM

This is a working prototype of the Design Engineering Atlas — an interactive knowledge graph of the empirical science-of-design-engineering literature, built in support of a paper currently under review for ASME IDETC 2026.

## About the Atlas

The Design Engineering Atlas maps the structure of the empirical DTM literature as a network of subjects, tasks, problems, and cognitive constructs. Every node is a concept extracted from the literature. Every edge is a co-occurrence — two concepts that appear together across the same papers.

The graph was extracted from 36 years of ASME Design Theory and Methodology (DTM) conference proceedings (1989–2025) using a multi-stage LLM pipeline.

| | |
|---|---|
| Nodes | 228 |
| Edges | 1,959 |
| Papers | 1,548 total · 601 empirical |
| Temporal range | 1989–2025 |

## Node types

| Color | Type | Count | Definition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Blue | Subjects | 12 | Agents whose behavior the study was designed to observe |
| Green | Tasks | 70 | Activities the subject performs that the study observes |
| Amber | Problems | 80 | Design briefs or prompts given to the subject |
| Purple | Cognitive Constructs | 66 | Cognitive or psychological phenomena the study illuminates |

## How to explore

- **Click any node** to see its connections and the papers behind them
- **Search** by node name using the top bar
- **Filter** by node type using the colored pills
- **Adjust** the edge weight slider to show only stronger connections
- **Temporal mode** traces the graph's growth from 1989 to present
